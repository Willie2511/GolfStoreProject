# GolfStoreProject

This is a personal project created primarily using Java, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It is a project I have developed twice using different programming languages. Secured the end points, encrypted passwords, developed a vibrant front end and a large database. To create the database run the script.sql file. This project was deployed using a wildfly server, therefore you must specify the database path in the standalone.xml file, along with username and password for access.

The project was created as a maven project, once the source code is downloaded, run maven clean, maven compile, maven install. 
Testing was extremely important therefore I performed unit testing, functional testing and end to end testing using technologies such as junit, selenium and cucumber.
