# GolfStoreProject

This is a personal project created primarily using Java, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It is a project I have developed twice using different programming languages.
Secured the end points, encrypted passwords, developed a vibrant front end and a large database, which is private. The result is a fully functioning online store.
Testing was extremely important therefore I performed unit testing, functional testing and end to end testing using technologies such as junit, selenium and cucumber.
